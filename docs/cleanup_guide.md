# Cleanup guide

The following guide describes how to temporarily stop working with the project 
to release the resources like RAM and CPU, and how to remove all persisted data.

## Stopping the cluster

To stop the cluster without removing its data, execute:

```shell
task cluster:stop
```

The cluster can be then started again with `task cluster:start`.

## Removing the cluster

To remove the containers in which the cluster is working, execute:

```shell
task cluster:delete
```

The above command will remove the cluster containers and its cache registries. 
However, it will not remove container images that are cached in Docker volumes.
This design decision allows to create the cluster faster, without having to pull the images from the internet.
To remove the cached images as well, execute:

```shell
task cluster:clean
```
