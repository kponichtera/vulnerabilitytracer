[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.11809584.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11809584)

The MSc thesis project of Konrad Ponichtera, supervised by Sebastian Proksch
and published under the title of "Leveraging Fine-grained Telemetry Data for the Detection and Prevention of Vulnerability Exploits".

If your workstation setup meets all prerequisites, you can start the experimental setup 
and run all the components by executing:

```shell
task
```

For the more comprehensive description of how to start working with the project, 
read the [quick start guide](docs/quick_start_guide.md).

## Documentation

1. [Quick start guide](docs/quick_start_guide.md)
2. [Cleanup guide](docs/cleanup_guide.md)

## Repository structure

The repository consists of the following directories:
* _api_ - the OpenAPI specifications, used to generate either servers (the coordinator and manager components of Vulnerability Tracer) 
  or clients (for FASTEN and Grafana Tempo querier)
* _cluster_ - part of experimental setup, contains the configuration files of [k3d](https://k3d.io/) Kubernetes cluster,
  used for development and evaluation of the developed solution
* _docs_ - additional documentation with instructions for starting the experimental setup and the developed solution
* _kube-manifests_ - [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) manifests used by [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) to deploy
  the developed solution and the scenarios for its qualitative and quantitative evaluation
* _loadgenerator_ - part of experimental setup, a basic load generator written in Rust, used to execute application endpoints 
  and generate distributed traces
* _microservices_ - part of experimental setup, two simple [Spring](https://spring.io/)-based Java services, 
  responsible for making downstream calls within the service mesh
* _misc_
  * _diagrams_ - DrawIO diagrams, used in the thesis paper
  * _plots_ - Jupyter notebooks with analysis of data, collected from the qualitative experiment scenarios
* _vulnerabilitytracer-dashboard_ - part of Vulnerability Tracer implementation, a web dashboard
* _vulnerabilitytracer-java_ - part of Vulnerability Tracer implementation, a Java instrumentation agent
* _vulnerabilitytracer-service_ - part of Vulnerability Tracer implementation, 
  a Go project with backend components of the developed solution

In addition to directories, there are following files:
* _Dockerfile_ - a Dockefile for building container images of the Java components
* _Dockerfile-dashboard_ - a Dockefile for building web dashboard
* _Dockerfile-vulnerabilitytracer_ - a Dockefile for building Go components of developed solution
* _skaffold-experiment.yaml_ - Skaffold file for building and deploying experimental scenarios
* _skaffold-opentelemetry.yaml_ - Skaffold file for building and deploying instrumentation agent
* _skaffold-vulnerabilitytracer.yaml_ - Skaffold file for building and deploying Vulnerability Tracer solution 
* _Taskfile.yml_ - root Taskfile of the project (remaining Taskfiles are included by the root one)
