            If the parameters are provided, it will only check in the blocks within the specified time range,

        Tempoâ€™s Search API finds traces based on span and process attributes (tags and values).
        When performing a search, Tempo does a massively parallel search over the given time range, and takes the first N results. 
        Even identical searches will differ due to things like machine load and network latency. TraceQL follows the same behavior.

        Implementations MAY assume SpanKind to be INTERNAL when receiving UNSPECIFIED.
         - SPAN_KIND_INTERNAL: Indicates that the span represents an internal operation within an application,
        as opposed to an operation happening at the boundaries. Default value.
         - SPAN_KIND_SERVER: Indicates that the span covers server-side handling of an RPC or other
        remote network request.

        between producer and consumer spans. A PRODUCER span ends when the message was accepted

            `flags & SPAN_FLAGS_TRACE_FLAGS_MASK`.

            See https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-2/#trace-flags for the flag definitions.

            Bits 8 and 9 represent the 3 states of whether the link is remote.
            The states are (unknown, is not remote, is remote).
            To read whether the value is known, use `(flags & SPAN_FLAGS_CONTEXT_HAS_IS_REMOTE_MASK) != 0`.
            To read whether the link is remote, use `(flags & SPAN_FLAGS_CONTEXT_IS_REMOTE_MASK) != 0`.

            Readers MUST NOT assume that bits 10-31 (22 most significant bits) will be zero.
            When creating new spans, bits 10-31 (most-significant 22-bits) MUST be zero.

            trace_state conveys information about request position in multiple distributed tracing graphs.
            It is a trace_state in w3c-trace-context format: https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#tracestate-header
            See also https://github.com/w3c/distributed-tracing for more details about this field.

          type: string
          description: |-
            The `span_id` of this span's parent span. If this is a root span, then this
            field must be empty. The ID is an 8-byte array.
        flags:
          type: integer
          description: |-
            Flags, a bit field.

            Bits 0-7 (8 least significant bits) are the trace flags as defined in W3C Trace
            Context specification. To read the 8-bit W3C trace flag, use
            `flags & SPAN_FLAGS_TRACE_FLAGS_MASK`.

            See https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-2/#trace-flags for the flag definitions.

            Bits 8 and 9 represent the 3 states of whether a span's parent
            is remote. The states are (unknown, is not remote, is remote).
            To read whether the value is known, use `(flags & SPAN_FLAGS_CONTEXT_HAS_IS_REMOTE_MASK) != 0`.
            To read whether the span is remote, use `(flags & SPAN_FLAGS_CONTEXT_IS_REMOTE_MASK) != 0`.

            When creating span messages, if the message is logically forwarded from another source
            with an equivalent flags fields (i.e., usually another OTLP span message), the field SHOULD
            be copied as-is. If creating from a source that does not have an equivalent flags field
            (such as a runtime representation of an OpenTelemetry span), the high 22 bits MUST
            be set to zero.
            Readers MUST NOT assume that bits 10-31 (22 most significant bits) will be zero.

            [Optional].

        name:
          type: string
          description: |-
            A description of the span's operation.

            For example, the name can be a qualified method name or a file name
            and a line number where the operation is called. A best practice is to use
            the same display name at the same call point in an application.
            This makes it easier to correlate spans in different traces.

            This field is semantically required to be set to non-empty string.
            Empty value is equivalent to an unknown span name.

            This field is required.

        attributes:
          title: |-
            attributes is a collection of key/value pairs. Note, global attributes
            like server name can be set using the resource API. Examples of attributes:

            The OpenTelemetry API specification further restricts the allowed value types:
            https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/common/README.md#attribute
            Attribute keys MUST be unique (it is not allowed to have more than one
            attribute with the same key).

            dropped_attributes_count is the number of attributes that were discarded. Attributes
            can be discarded because their keys are too long or because there are too many
